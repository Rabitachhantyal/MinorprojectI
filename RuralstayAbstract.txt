						Abstract

	The project is to build a web application that allows people to reserve community homestays (whole community homes involved in 
accomodation). These homestays donot or rarely have web level presence. This has caused people trying to stay and experience these 
homestays unable to reach to them through web method. They get access only through friends of friends or some other traditional marketing 
methods like banners, leaflet etc. There is a need for easier access which is fulfilled by RuralStay.

	These homestays primarily focus on their unique cultures rather than other features and facilities. Thus, RuralStay also targets 
that feature. User can search for homestays by direct search method or through culture's list prevailed in various homestays and book the
one they find ideal and interesting. Moreover, there is provision for the community hosts to add their homestays and create profile of 
them to get found easily.
